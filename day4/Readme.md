# 🎉 Welcome to **Course Day 4!**

Today’s theme: **Open Science, Sharing, and Project Quality**  
You’ll learn to **license**, **version**, **publish**, and **reflect** on your code!

---

## 🛠️ Activity 1: **Create a License & a Version Release**

> 📚 **Goal:** License your project and create a formal version for sharing.

### 📝 Steps:

1. **Create a License File**
   - In your **fork** of the course repository, create a new file:  
     `LICENSE.md`
   - Choose a license that fits your project (e.g., MIT, BSD, GPL).  
     👉 Tip: [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

2. **Commit Your License**
   - Write a clear commit message, e.g.,  
     `"Add MIT License"`

3. **Create a Version Release**
   - Go to your repo ➔ **Releases** ➔ **Draft a new release**.
   - Tag your release (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
   - Add a short title and description for your release.
   - Publish!

✅ **Result:** Your project now has a license **and** an official version release!

## 🌍 Activity 2: **Archive Your Project and Create a DOI (Zenodo)**

> 🏛️ **Goal:** Make your project permanently citable.

### 📝 Steps:

1. **Create a Zenodo Account**
   - Sign up at [https://zenodo.org/](https://zenodo.org/).

2. **Link Zenodo to GitHub**
   - In Zenodo, go to **Account ➔ GitHub**.
   - **Authorize access** and **enable your repository** for archiving.

3. **Publish and Generate a DOI**
   - After your GitHub Release, Zenodo will generate a **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier).
   - Use it to cite your code like a scientific publication!

✅ **Result:** Your project is now citable and permanently archived!

## 🤝 Activity 3: **Group Work – What Makes a Good Code Project?**

> 🧠 **Goal:** Reflect together on what makes software truly great.

### 📝 Steps:

- **Form small groups** (3–6 people).
- Brainstorm a **Checklist** for:

  > _"What makes a good code project?"_

💬 **Discuss:**
- Documentation quality
- Code structure and readability
- Testing and validation
- Licensing and citation
- Reusability and modularity
- Community contributions (issues, pull requests)
- Automation (Makefiles, CI/CD)

⚡ **Question:**  
> Did we miss anything important during the course?

🎤 **Be ready to share your checklist with the full group!**

## 📢 Why This Matters

- 🛡️ **Licensing** protects you and others.
- 🧪 **Versioning** makes science reproducible.
- 🧹 **Good project hygiene** makes your work easier to use, cite, and extend.
- 🚀 **Publishing** increases the reach and impact of your research.

> 🧠 _Remember:_  
> **Good research deserves good software.**  
> **Good software deserves to be shared well.**
